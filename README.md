# Algebraic_Factorization_AVLSI
The project consists in implementing an algorithm to find a good factorization of a Boolean expression using algebraic methods. For a given example the factorization algorithm could find a multi-level expression. The algorithm used is based on kernel extraction and reduces the problem to finding rectangles in a Boolean matrix.
